In our modern world, we have seen many emerging technologies which put our lives at ease in specific ways of interaction with devices by physically touching them.
 It is difficult to use the touch screen system for some instances like the COVID pandemic. In order to avoid those circumstances, we use an Alternate Technique such as object detection with 
a Computer-vision based control system, by adding gestures for certain vivid tasks to accomplish them wit
hout direct interaction with the system.
The gesture control technique uses hand gestures or expressions, which are captured from the digital camera with the help of OpenCV libraries.

A virtual gesture system is created with the goal of elucidating human gestures using geometry calculations. Gesture detection can be seen as a way for computers to begin 
to recognize human body language, thus bridging the gap between humans and computers. 
When gestures are detected, it performs the desired I/O functions like cursor movement, scroll 
wheel and some of basic operations like scroll, zoom,right click , left click,novice ASL etc.
This project is focused on deep learning for detecting gestures. This method will avoid the spread 
of the COVID-19 crisis by reducing human interaction with the devices to control the system in 
crowded cities. To make this system as completely contactless interaction by adding voice enabled commands.Thus exploring this problem, a system for gesture-enabled commands for 
operating Laptop/pc can be achieved.

WorkFlow:
    * We have started with detecting the hands through OpenCV and Mediapipe
    * After that we fix the handtracking points and by calculating the distance between those points the system can perform Click,Move,Right-Click,Left- Click,Scroll,Zoom Actions etc.,
    * Based on suggestions of the invilgilator,we incorporated American Sign Language (ALS) in our program to help differently-abled people.
    * To make our project completely contactless, we made it voice accessable.We also included several voice assistant features.
